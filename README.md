# jupyterlab-datascience

:exclamation: **Developer note:** As mentioned in [the official Jupyter image stack repository, newer images are pushed to quay.io](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start). Please pull from `quay.io/jupyter/datascience-notebook` when developing new Tools and Apps.

[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Datascience Notebook with a few added packages for use in [CyVerse Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org)

Jupyter Lab Datascience image built from the [Datascience Notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook) for [CyVerse VICE](https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html). Project Jupyter's base image requires a couple additional configuration files for it be compatible with CyVerse Kubernetes orchestration and iRODS data store.

## Development

1. Use either CodeSpaces or another clean Dev Environment that you trust to clone the repository

**note**: The larger datascience images (e.g., `geospatial`, `earthlab`, or ML types with CUDA, Tensorflow or Pytorch) are all >5GB in size when compressed and can be over 30GB when uncompressed. Make sure to use a VM with enough RAM and Disk storage (suggest >8 cores, >16 GB RAM, >60 GB disk).

2. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/cyverse-vice/jupyterlab-datascience
```

3. Determine what version the current `latest` image is running, and prepare a new folder with that version of JupyterHub if it is no longer `latest`.

Visit the [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) pages

4. Rename the previous `latest` as its point release version number

5. Create a copy of the directory `latest` and make any updates required for broken package dependencies

6. Build the new image using the `latest` tag name

7. Test the new image by running it with a suitable sample notebook

8. Check the GitHub Action to make sure it is using the `latest` featured build successfully 

9. Push changes back to GitHub repository `main` branch and wait until GitHub Action completes.

## Running Docker locally or on a Virtual Machine

To run the JupyterLab, you must first `pull` from DockerHub, or activate a [CyVerse Account](https://user.cyverse.org/services/mine) and launch in the Discovery Environment VICE.

The container for running JupyterLab is hosted on DockerHub and can be started locally:

```
docker pull harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

## Run Docker container in CyVerse VICE

Unless you plan on making changes to this container, you should just use the existing launch button above.

You can build a new Docker container with additional dependencies from this Docker Hub image by using the `FROM cyversevice/jupyterlab-scipy:latest` at the beginning of your own Dockerfile.

## Developer notes

To test the container locally:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -e REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8888 harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

To build your own container with a Dockerfile and additional dependencies, pull the pre-built image from DockerHub:

```
FROM harbor.cyverse.org/vice/jupyter/datascience:latest
```

Follow the instructions in the [VICE manual for integrating your own tools and apps](https://learning.cyverse.org/vice/extend_apps/#building-an-app-for-your-tool).
